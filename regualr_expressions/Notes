Regualr expressions allow us to search for specifc patterns within text.

To search for litteral chacters you can search:
/abc/ => abc
Expressions are case sensative. So:
    abc !== abc

Meta Characters:
.[{(\^$|?*+)}]
To escape a meta character you would use: \

. = Any chacter except new lines
\d = any diget 0-9
\D = not a digit
\w


Anchors match invisible characters
