A linear Search on Arrays

KMP Searching Algorithm

Linear Search:
Given an Array, the simplest way to search for a value is to look at every element in the array and check if its the value we want
    The best way to find an item in an unsorted list is to iterate over each one.
        Examples:
            indexOf()
            includes()
            findIndex()
    Big O = O(n)

Binary Search:
    Only works on array is sorted. 
    Much faster form of Searching
    Rather than eliminate 1 element at a time, you can eleiminate half of the remaaining elements at a time.
        Basically Divide and Conquer.
        Picks a pivot point
