So between option 1 and 2, which one is better?
    Faster?
    Less Memory?
    More readable?
We are going to focus on speed. W can find out by using a built in time method.
Rememebr: both the same and different machines can run the same code in a different amount of time.

You wangt to count the number of operations.
    operations can be:
        Actual operatiors, such as  *,/,+,-
        Assignmnets of values
        comparisons
            If you are in a loop, the number of operations can change depending on variables.

            There are typically 3 different types:
                Linear -> O(f(n)=n)
                Constant-> O(f(n)=1)
                Quadratic-> O(f(n)=n^2)
