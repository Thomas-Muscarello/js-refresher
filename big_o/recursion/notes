Recursion: Is a different way to think about writing a solution
    -Taking one problem and doing it on a smaller piece until you reach an end
    -A FUNCTION THAT CALLS ITSELF-
    -Example json.parge/json.stringify

Call Stack: built in data structre that managaes what happens when a function is invoked
    -When a function is invoked it is placed at the top of the call stack.
    -When JS sees the return keywood or when the function ends, the compiler will remove from the top
    -When we write recursive functions we keep pushing new functions onto the call stack
