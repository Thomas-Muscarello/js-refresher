When to use objects:
    when you dont need order
    When you need fast access/ insertion and removal
        Constant time
            Insertion - O(1)
            Removal - O(1)
            Searching - O(n)
            Access - O(1)

When to use Arrays:
    When you need order
    When you need fast access/ insertion and removal (SORT OF...)
        Access is constant time
        Insertion/Removal:
            .push/ .pop to add/remove from the end of an array is an O(1)
            .shift/unshift to add/remove from the front, it then has to reindex for every item in an array
                It is an O(n)
        Searching
            O(n)
