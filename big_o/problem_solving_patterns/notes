Some names of common Patterns:
    -Frequency COunter
    -Multiple Pointers
    -Sliding Window
    -Divide and Conquer
    -Dynamic Programming
    -Greedy Algorithms
    -Backtracking

Frequency Counters: Pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/ frequencies of values
    -This can often avoif the need for nested loops or o(n^2) operations with arrays/strings
    -Use an object to construct a profile so that you can break down the contents of an array or string. The you are able to compare that breakdown to how another object looks that was constructed that way as well.

Multiple Pointers: Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on certain conditions
    -Efficient for solving problems w/ minimal space complexity

Sliding Window: Pattern involves creating a window which can either be an array or number from one position to another.
    -Depending on a certain condition, the window either increasses or closes (and a new window is created)
    -Very Useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string
