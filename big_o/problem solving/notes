What is an algorithm?
    -process or set of steps to accomplish a task.
How do you improve?
    -Devise a plan for solving problems.
    -Master common problem solving patterns

Look at Function.js
Understanding the problem
    -Restate the pronlem in your own word.
    -What are the inputs
    -What should be returned
    -Can the output be determined from the input?
    -How to lable important pieces of data

Look at Function2.js
Explore concrete Example
    -Start with Simple Examples
    -Progress to more complex Examples
    -Explore examples with empty inputs
    -Explore examples with invalid input

Look at Function2.js
Break it down
    -Explicity write out the steps needed to taken
        -forces you to think about your code.
        -Catch any lingering conceptual issues
    
Solve/simplify
    -Try to solve the problem
    -If you can't, try to solve a simmpler problem so that you can focus on the bulk.
        -Find the core difficulty in what youre doing
        -Temporarity ignore the difficulty
        -Write a simplified solution
        -Then incorparate that difficulty back in.

Look back and refactor
    -Can you check the result
    -Can you get the result differntly
    -Can you understand at a glance
    -Can it be used to solve another problem
    -Can you improve the performance of the solution
    can you think of other ways to refactor
    -How have other people solved this problem
