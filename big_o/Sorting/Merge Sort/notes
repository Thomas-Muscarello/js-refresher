Merge Sorting
Understanding our limits
The previouse sorting examples dont scale well

These new ones can imporve time complexity from O(n^2) to O(nlogn)
Trade off between efficiency and simplicity
The more efficient alogorithms are much less simple and generally take longer to understand

Merge Sort
Combonation of: Spliting Up, Merging and Sorting
Exploits the fact thtat arrays of 0 or 1 element are always sorted
Works by decomposing array into smaller arrays of 0 or 1 elements, then building up a newly sorted array
