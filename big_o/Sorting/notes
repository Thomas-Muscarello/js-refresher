    -Doesnt always work the way you want it to.

    -You can use this comparator function to tell JS how you want it to sort
    -The comparator looks at pairs of elements (a and b), determines their sort order based on the return value
        if it returns a negative number, a should come before b
        if it is a positive number, a should ocme after b 
        if it returns a 0, a and b are the same as far as the sort is concered
