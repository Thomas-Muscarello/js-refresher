Elementry Sortinf Algorithms
What is sorting: Rearranging the items in a collection so that the items are in some kinf of order
    Example:
        -Shortest to Longest
        -Sort names A-Z
        -Sorting movies based on release year or revenue
Purpose:
    -Common task within software engineering
    -Many ways to sort with their own pros and cons
    -Classic Interview Topic

Objectives: 
    Bubble Sort
    Selection Sort
    Insertion Sort

Built In Sorting Method...
    Array.sort
    -Doesnt always work the way you want it to.
    -Accepts an optional comparator function
    -You can use this comparator function to tell JS how you want it to sort
    -The comparator looks at pairs of elements (a and b), determines their sort order based on the return value
        if it returns a negative number, a should come before b
        if it is a positive number, a should ocme after b 
        if it returns a 0, a and b are the same as far as the sort is concered
    
Bubble Sort:
    A Sorting Algorithm where the largest values bubble up to the top

    As we loop, we compare the value to the one infront of it.
        if it is larger, swap it to the front
    SWAPPING
        function swap(arr,indx1,indx2){
            let temp = arr[indx1];
            arr[indx1]=arr[indx2];
            arr[indx2]=temp;
        }
        -OR-
        const swap = (arr, indx1, indx2) =>{
            [arr[indx1], arr[indx2]]= [arr[indx2], arr[indx1]];
        }

Selection Sort:
    Similar to bubble sort, but instead of first placing large values into sorted position, it places small values into sorted position.
        Still moving from beggining to end
        Compare the first element to the other elements in an array and then swap it when the minimum is found.
        [5,3,4,1,2] =>[1,3,4,5,2]

Insertion Sort:
    Builds up the sort by gradually creating a larger half which is always sorted.
    [5,3,4,1,2]
    [3,5,4,1,2]
    [3,4,5,1,2]
    [1,3,4,5,2]
    [1,2,3,4,5]
        COmes in Handy when you need to sort data as it comes in such as a live stream


Allgorithm      Time Complexity         Space Complexity
                Best/ Average /Worst

Bubble Sort     O(n)/O(n^2)/ O(n^2)         O(1)

Insertion Sort  O(n)/O(n^2)/ O(n^2)         O(1)

Selection Sort  O(n^2)/O(n^2)/ O(n^2)       O(1)

These are the easier sorting but do not scale well.
